          <h2>Leadership</h2>
          <p>School leaders enthusiastically face the challenging task of preparing young minds for the future, and they think strategically about the goals and systems that will support this task. There are a number of different traits, skills, mindsets, and habits that define school leaders. <br><br>
             Personal qualities like curiosity, persistence, resilience, flexibility, responsibility and hard work are as important as ever for leaders. Whatever changes come, these school principal leadership qualities are always the key to success. Part of being a leader is having the will to work on personal growth and improving yourself constantly. <br><br>
             Other qualities are increasingly important for leaders: creativity, entrepreneurship, innovation, constant learning and teamwork are all crucial for today’s leaders. At Wellington College we encourage and teach all students to lead their school with pride and respect. <br><br>
             We make sure that students are shed in a positive light for all the younger student to come in further generations. This is why leadership is one of the 4 COLL values in this school.<br>
