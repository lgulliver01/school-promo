          <h2>Oranga</h2>
          <p>The school employs a ‘student-help-student’ programme to build relationship skills and self-esteem. It has been run at Wellington College since 1992 and is backed by the Rotary Club of Port Nicholson. <br><br>
          Year 13 (senior) students are trained by a small group of certificated Peer Support teachers. These seniors are shown how to lead a group in activities and discussion. The leaders in turn are put in charge of a group of new entrant Year 9 students. They assist with their induction into the College, especially to assist them in making the transition to life at College. <br><br>
          There is also a Wellbeing Day day for our Year 12 and 13 students to discuss issues related to Wellbeing. It is predominantly student driven with students deciding upon the keynote speaker(s) and the workshop content. The day is based around The Whare Tapa Wha. This Maori philosophy towards health is based on a wellness or holistic health model. Seeing health as a four-sided concept representing the four basic beliefs of life. <br><br>
          Workshops in the past have covered topics such as financial education, healthy diets, yoga, resilience and sexual health. <br>
