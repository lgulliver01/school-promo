          <p>Founded in 1867, Wellington College  is a progressive school for the 21st century boys which values belonging and is connected to the past.  We have a proud history of outstanding academic achievement and a record of national success in both sports and in the performing arts. <br><br>
          The aspirations of  Wellington College and its people are summarised through our COLL  values.  They provide a focus for our work as we serve others, develop leadership and care for each other as we  learn together. <br><br>
          Of our 1780 students,  approximately 150 identify as Māori.   Some of these students have connections with the Taranaki Whānui – Te  Upoko o Te Ika, the Tangata Whenua of our area. <br><br>
          The international  student programme contributes to the diversity of our school community and  generates additional funding for school projects and facilities on our  beautiful, spacious city campus.  Our international  student programme adheres to the Code  of Practice for the Pastoral Care of International Students, 2016. <br><br>
          Through our Kāhui  Ako (Community of Leaning) we collaborate with contributing primary schools  and Wellington Girls’ College to develop approaches which support student  wellbeing, culturally responsive practice and student agency in learning. <br><br>
          Thank you for your interest in Wellington College. We look forward to meeting you, making connections, learning and working. <br>
